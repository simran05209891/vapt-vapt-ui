# VAPT UI Frontend

This is the frontend UI for the Automated Enterprise VAPT Scanner.

It is built using React + Vite and integrates with the FastAPI-based VAPT engine to perform:
- Recon scans
- Fast scans
- Deep VAPT scans
- Web scans
- Dashboard and results visualization

This UI will be deployed on the same server where the VAPT API is running.
